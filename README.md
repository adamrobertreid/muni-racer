# Racing Cars
#### What is this project?
To build a browser game, synthesizing all the knowledge we've learnt over the past two weeks.
We will be leveraging the power of JQuery to create a **Racing Game**, where two players can move their "bikes
across the browser to compete for the win.

## Game Title: Dodge MUNI

######Game Intro
Dodge MUNI, is a 2D game that will run on a browser. The first version 1.0 of this game will consist of creating an
object *(bike)* that will be able to move from the bottom of the game container to the top of the container. After
version 1.0 extra features will be added to the game to create a more entertaining experience for the user. Ideally 
the gamer will be able to race against another player through a street trying not to get hit by a MUNI bus. 

### Technical Requirements
Technologies I will be using to create this game are:
- JQuery
- Object Oriented Programming *(design patterns)*
- Create and use seperate **HTML, CSS, & JavaScript** files.
- Create a CSS styling that is pleasing for UI
- **KISS** (keep it simple stupid) & **DRY** (Don't Repaet Yourself)
- Include a **public GitHub Respository**.
